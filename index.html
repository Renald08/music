	<p>Hello, you awake right now?
    God, I just need to hear the sound of you
    Please calm me down
    And I know that it's selfish, but
    You are the only thing that's
    Ever made sense to me, I
    I don't wanna do this
    I don't know how to do this without you
    Cling to your side, voices at night
    Cover my eyes, I'm terrified
    No in between, a face on a screen
    Ain't an adequate replacement for your being with me (Yeah-yeah)</p>

    <h2><b><u>[Pre chorus]</u></b></h2> 
    <p>Too much time in the limelight
Gimme your all on the landline
Want it so bad, but I won't lie
And it just gets worse in the nighttime
Never stays for long (Ooh, da-da-da-da-da)
And she's gone in the morning (Ooh)</p>

	<h2><b><u>[Chorus]</u></b></h2>
	<p><b>When you come home
I just got over bein' less of you
When you leave me, I'm in pieces
Maybe it's better if we cut it loose</b></p>

	<h2><b><u>[Verse 2]</u></b></h2> 
	<p>Tell me how your day was
No, I'm not okay
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Time never moved so slow
Bed time, hit your phone up
Tell me where to go, where to go
Tell me where to go, where to go-oh-oh</p>

	<h2><b><u>[Pre chorus]</u></b></h2> 
	<p>Too much time in the limelight
Gimme your all on the landline
Want it so bad, but I won't lie
And it just gets worse in the nighttime
Never stays for long (Ooh, da-da-da-da-da)
And she's gone in the morning (Ooh)</p>

	<h2><b><u>[Chorus]</u></b></h2>
	<p><b>When you come home
I just got over bein' less of you
When you leave me, I'm in pieces
Maybe it's better if we cut it loose</b></p>

	<h2><b><u>[Refrain]</u></b></h2> 
	<p>I don't know how to do this without you
I don't know, I don't know, don't know
I don't know how to do this without you
I don't know, I don't know, don't know
I don't know how to do this without you</p>
